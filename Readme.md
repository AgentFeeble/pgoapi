# Swift Pokemon GO API

This is still a work in progress. The only working function at the moment is login via PTC.

## Credit
Thank you to all the open source projects working together to make this possible, including, but not limited to Luke Sapan, with his  [Swift API](https://github.com/lsapan/pgoapi-swift)  that gave me a push in the right direction, and AeonLucid for providing and maintaining the [POGO Protocol Buffer files](https://github.com/AeonLucid/POGOProtos).
